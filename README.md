# K8s-scripts
## Overview
Bash scripts to make it easier to do common/repetitive kubectl commands. You may or may not need these particular functions, but hopefully this gives you ideas on what you can do yourself to make your life a little easier when working with CLI tools.

## Installation
These scripts can be copied into your shell configuration file (ex: .zshrc, .bashrc, .profile, etc.) so that the functions are available in your shell app of choice.

## Configuration
These scripts are specific to my workflow needs, so make sure to update them to match your needs (for example using the correct context, namespaces, etc.)

Run `source .zshrc` (or whatever file you are adding the functions to) to force your shell to load the contents after making changes.
